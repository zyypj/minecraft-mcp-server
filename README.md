A Minecraft bot powered by large language models and [Mineflayer API](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer). This bot uses the [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) (MCP) to enable Claude and other supported models to control a Minecraft character.

## Monorepo layout

This repository is a [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) workspace. The build engine is split into focused packages:

| Package | Name | Role |
|---|---|---|
| [`mcp/`](mcp) | `@mcbuild/mcp` | MCP server — the LLM-facing tool surface and orchestrator (evolved from the original bot server) |
| [`engine/`](engine) | `@mcbuild/engine` | Build engine — deterministic, rule-driven parametric geometry pipeline |
| [`renderer/`](renderer) | `@mcbuild/renderer` | Camera / renderer — turns extracted block data into multi-angle PNGs |
| [`protocol/`](protocol) | `@mcbuild/protocol` | Shared contract — JSON-RPC types + zod schemas shared by the MCP server and the plugin |
| [`plugin/`](plugin) | (Java) | Paper server plugin — commits blocks directly into the world (not a Node workspace) |

The overarching architecture, phased roadmap, and rule system are documented in [BUILD_ENGINE_PLAN.md](BUILD_ENGINE_PLAN.md).

Common workspace scripts (run from the repo root): `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm dev:mcp`.

## Legacy (bot backend)

> The sections below describe the original Mineflayer player-bot backend. It remains the **default** backend (`--backend=bot`) and works exactly as before; it is retained as a fallback through milestone M5 (see [BUILD_ENGINE_PLAN.md](BUILD_ENGINE_PLAN.md) §9). The bot server now lives in the [`mcp/`](mcp) package.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js (>= 20.10.0)
- A running Minecraft game (the setup below was tested with Minecraft 1.21.8 Java Edition included in Microsoft Game Pass)
- An MCP-compatible client. Claude Desktop will be used as an example, but other MCP clients are also supported

## Getting started

This bot is designed to be used with Claude Desktop through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

### Run Minecraft

Create a singleplayer world and open it to LAN (`ESC -> Open to LAN`). Bot will try to connect using port `25565` and hostname `localhost`. These parameters could be configured in `claude_desktop_config.json` on a next step. 

### MCP Configuration

Make sure that [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) is installed. Open `File -> Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config`. It should open installation directory. Find file with a name `claude_desktop_config.json` and insert the following code:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "minecraft": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "github:yuniko-software/minecraft-mcp-server",
        "--host",
        "localhost",
        "--port",
        "25565",
        "--username",
        "ClaudeBot"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Double-check that right `--port` and `--host` parameters were used. Make sure to completely reboot the Claude Desktop application (should be closed in OS tray). 

## Running

Make sure Minecraft game is running and the world is opened to LAN. Then start Claude Desktop application and the bot should join the game. 

**It could take some time for Claude Desktop to boot the MCP server**. The marker that the server has booted successfully:

You can give bot any commands through any active Claude Desktop chat. You can also upload images of buildings and ask bot to build them 😁

Don't forget to mention that bot should do something in Minecraft in your prompt. Because saying this is a trigger to run MCP server. It will ask for your permissions.

Using Claude Sonnet could give you some interesting results. The bot-agent would be really smart 🫡

Example usage: [shared Claude chat](https://claude.ai/share/535d5f69-f102-4cdb-9801-f74ea5709c0b)
